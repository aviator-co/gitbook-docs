# Opportunities

Opportunities represent automatically identified areas for code improvement. The system continuously scans repositories to find optimization potential.

## How Opportunities Work

1. **Scanning**: Agents periodically analyze configured repositories
2. **Analysis**: Code patterns, anti-patterns, and improvement areas identified
3. **Classification**: Each opportunity assigned confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
4. **Presentation**: Results displayed in web dashboard for review

## Opportunity Types

* **Code Quality**: Duplicated code, complex methods, poor naming
* **Performance**: Inefficient algorithms, resource leaks, bottlenecks
* **Security**: Vulnerable dependencies, unsafe practices
* **Modernization**: Deprecated APIs, outdated patterns
* **Testing**: Low coverage areas, missing test cases

## Confidence Levels

* **High**: Clear improvement with minimal risk
* **Medium**: Beneficial change with moderate complexity
* **Low**: Potential improvement requiring careful review
