# Product backlog

Transform your product backlog from a list of wishes into automated implementations. Runbooks excels at taking feature requests and systematically implementing them across your codebase with AI-powered automation.

### When to use

#### Ideal scenarios

* **Feature Rollouts**: Implementing new features across multiple components
* **UI/UX Improvements**: Adding new interface elements or improving user experience
* **Cross-cutting Features**: Features that need to be implemented in multiple places
* **Standardization**: Implementing company-wide features or standards
* **Infrastructure Features**: Adding monitoring, logging, or security features

#### Perfect for teams that

* Have consistent architectural patterns
* Need to implement similar features across multiple services
* Want to maintain consistency in feature implementation
* Have clear feature specifications and requirements

### Available templates

From the runbooks library, these templates help implement user-facing features:

**Dark mode implementation**

* Automatically adds dark mode support to applications
* Implements theme switching logic
* Updates color schemes and styling consistently
* Adds user preference storage

**Responsive design conversion**

* Converts legacy layouts to modern responsive design
* Updates CSS and layout components
* Adds interactive drag and drop features

**Feature infrastructure templates**

* Implements modern loading states
* Adds skeleton components for better UX

### Without using templates

#### 1. Feature analysis and planning

Start by clearly defining your feature requirements:

```
"I want to add dark mode support to our React application. The app should:
- Remember user's theme preference
- Support system theme detection
- Apply consistent theming across all components
- Include a theme toggle in the header"
```

**What runbooks does:**

* Analyzes your current styling architecture (CSS-in-JS, SCSS, etc.)
* Identifies all components that need theme support
* Plans the implementation strategy
* Creates a step-by-step execution plan

#### 2. Architecture assessment

Runbooks examines your codebase to understand:

* Current styling patterns and conventions
* State management approach (Redux, Context, etc.)
* Component structure and hierarchy
* Existing theme or styling infrastructure

#### 3. Implementation planning

The AI creates a detailed runbook covering:

* Theme system architecture
* Component updates needed
* State management changes
* Testing requirements
* Documentation updates

#### 4. Automated implementation

Runbooks executes the plan by:

* Creating theme provider components
* Updating existing components with theme support
* Implementing theme toggle functionality
* Adding user preference persistence
* Updating styling across the application

### Real-world examples

#### Example 1: Adding search functionality

**User request:**

```
"Add search functionality to our e-commerce platform. Use existing Elasticsaerch integration.
 Users should be able to:
- Search products by name, category, and tags
- See real-time search suggestions
- Filter results by price, rating, and availability
- Save search history"
```

**Runbook implementation:**

1. **Backend API development**
   * Explores existing Elasticsearch integration
   * Implement autocomplete and suggestion APIs
   * Add search analytics tracking
2. **Frontend search components**
   * Build search input with autocomplete
   * Create search results page with filtering
   * Implement search history storage
3. **Database updates**
   * Add search indexes
   * Create search analytics tables
   * Update product schema for search optimization

#### Example 2: Implementing user notifications

**User request:**

```
"Implement a notification system that shows:
- Real-time alerts for important events
- Toast notifications for user actions
- Email digest for weekly summaries
- Push notifications for mobile users"
```

**Runbook implementation:**

1. **Notification infrastructure**
   * Set up WebSocket connections for real-time updates
   * Create notification storage and management
   * Implement notification templates
2. **UI components**
   * Build notification center component
   * Create toast notification system
   * Add notification preferences page
3. **External integrations**
   * Configure email service integration
   * Set up push notification services
   * Add notification analytics
