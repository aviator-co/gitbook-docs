# Collaborating with the team

The platform supports team collaboration through shared [Runbooks](runbook-format.md) and coordinated execution.

## Adding Collaborators

Collaborators receive same access as the primary user. You can add the collaborator from the chat interface of the Runbook. Simply navigate to the "Share" button, search for a team member and Invite. The invited member will receive an email with the link to the Runbook. You can also copy the link and share with your team member directly after adding them as a collaborator.

### Collaborator's access

All collaborators see the same Runbook version. All the changes are immediately visible to all team members. The collaborators can also view the execution history, edit the Runbook or execute any step.

## Best Practices for Teams

* Establish clear ownership for Runbooks
* Use descriptive names and documentation
* Regular reviews of generated changes
* Coordinate execution timing
* Share learnings through global context
