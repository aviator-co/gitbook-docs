# Security

Remote agents follow comprehensive security measures for protecting code and infrastructure.

## Deployment Security

### **Network Isolation**

* No ingress requirements for on-premise
* All outbound connections to GitHub
* Internal communication only

### **Authentication & Authorization**

* GitHub App OAuth flow
* Role-based access control
* Session management
* API key rotation

## Data Security

### **Code Handling**

* Temporary storage only
* Encrypted at rest
* Secure deletion after use
* No persistent code storage

### **Audit Logging**

* All actions logged
* Tamper-proof storage
* Retention policies
* Export capabilities

## Compliance Features

### **Access Control**

```
Role              Permissions
────              ───────────
Admin             Full system access
Developer         Runbook create/edit/execute
Reviewer          Read-only, PR approve
Auditor           Logs and reports only
```

### **Team Isolation**

* Separate workspaces
* No cross-team visibility
* Independent resource allocation
* Isolated execution environments

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**
   * Keep agents updated
   * Patch dependencies
   * Update LLM models
2. **Access Management**
   * Principle of least privilege
   * Regular access reviews
   * MFA enforcement
3. **Monitoring**
   * Anomaly detection
   * Usage patterns
   * Failed authentication attempts
   * Resource consumption
4. **Incident Response**
   * Clear escalation procedures
   * Automated alerts
   * Rollback capabilities
   * Post-mortem process
