# Webhooks

Your application can use webhooks to subscribe to events happening on your Aviator account.

When configuring a webhook, you can use the UI to choose which event actions will send you payloads. Only subscribing to the specific events you plan on handling limits the number of HTTP requests to your server. You can also subscribe to all current and future event actions. You can change the list of subscribed events anytime.

Each event corresponds to a certain set of actions that can happen on your organizationâ€™s repository. For example, if you subscribe to the merge failure event you'll receive detailed payloads every time a PR fails to merge.

## PullRequest events

### Payload

Each PullRequest webhook event payload contains the following properties.&#x20;
