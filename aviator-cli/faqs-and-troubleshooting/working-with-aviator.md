# Working with Aviator

The Stacked PRs CLI is free and open-source, that means you can use the CLI with no usage caps without creating an Aviator account. Simply follow the [<mark style="color:blue;">installation instructions</mark>](../installation.md) to set up the CLI locally.

## MergeQueue

[<mark style="color:blue;">Aviator MergeQueue</mark>](../../mergequeue/) is a powerful merge-based automated workflow for pull requests in your GitHub repository and keeps your primary branch passing. Although completely optional, using the Aviator MergeQueue along with the stacked PRs CLI can significantly improve the developer experience for [<mark style="color:blue;">merging and updating the PRs</mark>](https://docs.aviator.co/mergequeue/how-to-guides/merging-stacked-prs).

To enable MergeQueue with Stacked PRs, create an Aviator account, [<mark style="color:blue;">configure MergeQueue mode</mark>](../../mergequeue/quick-setup.md), and [<mark style="color:blue;">set up the Aviator user access token</mark>](../how-to-guides/create-a-user-access-token.md#aviator-user-access-token) in your Stacked PRs CLI config.

### Chrome Extension

[<mark style="color:blue;">Chrome Extension</mark>](../../mergequeue/aviator-chrome-extension.md) is also a great way to visualize your stack from within GitHub pull request page.
