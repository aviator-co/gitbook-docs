# Quickstart

This page explains how to use Aviator CLI to drive day-to-day development.

## Before you begin

1. [<mark style="color:blue;">Install Aviator CLI</mark>](installation.md)
2. [<mark style="color:blue;">Set up GitHub Personal Access Token</mark>](configuration.md#github-personal-access-token)
3. Clone your repository locally

## Initialize your repository with Aviator CLI

Run `av init` inside your repository. You need to do this only once per your local clone.

```
$ av init
Successfully initialized repository for use with av!
```

## Create a topic branch

Create a branch with `av stack branch BRANCH_NAME` from `main`.

```
$ git switch main
Already on 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
$ av stack branch mytopic
$ echo "Some changes" > testfile
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add a new file"
[mytopic b420345] Add a new file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 testfile
```

The topic branch `mytopic` is intended to be merged to `main` later. If you want to use other branch as the merge destination, checkout that branch first.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "1"
    commit id: "2"
    branch mytopic
    checkout mytopic
    commit id: "b420345"
```

## Create a pull-request

Create a pull-request with `av pr create`. It shows an editor for the pull-request description. Every time you update your local branch, you can run this to update the pull-request.

```
$ av pr create
Creating pull request for branch mytopic:
  - pushing to origin/mytopic
  - created pull request https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo/pull/16
```

## Stack a new topic branch

Create a new topic branch on top of the current topic branch with `av stack branch`.

```
$ av stack branch another_topic
```

You can see the stack with `av stack tree`.

```
$ av stack tree
  * another_topic (HEAD, need sync)
  │ No pull request
  │
  * mytopic
  │ https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo/pull/16
  │
  * main
```

Add more changes to the branch.

```
$ echo "More changes" > newfile
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add another file"
[another_topic f60c4da] Add another file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 newfile
```

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "1"
    commit id: "2"
    branch mytopic
    checkout mytopic
    commit id: "b420345"
    branch another_branch
    checkout another_branch
    commit id: "f60c4da"
```

## Create a second pull-request

The second pull-request can be created with `av pr create` now.

```
$ av pr create
Creating pull request for branch another_topic:
  - pushing to origin/another_topic
  - created pull request https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo/pull/17
```

You can see the pull-request URLs with `av stack tree`.

```
$ av stack tree
  * another_topic (HEAD)
  │ https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo/pull/17
  │
  * mytopic
  │ https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo/pull/16
  │
  * main
```

The first pull-request is targeting the `main` branch. And the second pull-request is targeting the first pull-request branch.

This will be updated once you merge the first pull-request.

## Merge and sync the pull-requests

Let's merge the first pull-request now. We merge the first pull-request and keep the second pull-request open.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "1"
    commit id: "2"
    branch mytopic
    checkout mytopic
    commit id: "b420345"
    branch another_branch
    checkout another_branch
    commit id: "f60c4da"
    checkout main
    merge mytopic
```

After this, we want to make the second one to be rebased on top of the newly updated `main` branch. To do this, we run `av stack sync`.

```
$ av stack sync

  ✓ GitHub fetch is done
  ✓ Restack is done

    * ✓ another_topic e808923
    │
    │ * mytopic (merged) 6d19ed1
    ├─┘
    * main ba8eefe

  Confirming the push to GitHub

    Following branches do not need a push.

    Following branches need to be pushed.

  Are you OK with pushing these branches to remote?
    ▸ Yes. Push the branches to GitHub.
      No. Do not push the branches to GitHub.

```

It fetches the latest `main` from the remote, rebase the second branch on top of it. Choose to push to the remote.

```
$ av stack sync

  ✓ GitHub fetch is done
  ✓ Restack is done

    * ✓ another_topic e808923
    │
    │ * mytopic (merged) 6d19ed1

  Confirming the deletion of merged branches

    Following merged branches can be deleted.

      mytopic: 6d19ed1f0019d0f59b65177ef7a4f358c278baec

  Are you OK with deleting these merged branches?
    ▸ Yes. Delete these merged branches.
      No. Do not delete the merged branches.
  ↑/k move up • ↓/j move down • space/enter select • ctrl+c cancel

```

Since the first branch is already merged, it asks you if you want to delete the local branch. Choose yes to delete the merged branch.

&#x20;If you run `av stack tree`, you can see that the second branch now has `main` as the parent.

```
$ av stack tree
  * another_topic
  │ https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo/pull/17
  │
  * main (HEAD)
```
