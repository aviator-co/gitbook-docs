# Adopt a Branch

Aviator CLI needs to maintain the metadata for branches so that it can remember the parent-child relationships among them. If you create branches with `av stack branch`, the metadata is created upon branch creation. You can attach the metadata for branches that are created with `git branch`.

## Create a repository

We will use an example repository from [<mark style="color:blue;">https://github.com/octocat/hello-world</mark>](https://github.com/octocat/hello-world). Clone it and initialize the Aviator CLI.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/octocat/hello-world
Cloning into 'hello-world'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 13, done.
remote: Total 13 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 13
Receiving objects: 100% (13/13), done.
$ cd hello-world
$ av init
Successfully initialized repository for use with av!
```

## Creating a branch outside of av

Instead of using `av stack branch`, we use a normal Git command to create a branch and a commit.

```
$ git switch --create mytopic
Switched to a new branch 'mytopic'
$ git commit --allow-empty --message="New commit"
[mytopic d384683] New commit
```

As we can see, the newly created branch `mytopic` is not tracked in `av stack tree`, but it's shown in `git branch`.

```
$ av stack tree
$ git branch -vv
  master  7fd1a60 [origin/master] Merge pull request #6 from Spaceghost/patch-1
* mytopic d384683 New commit
```

## Adopting a branch with av stack sync

By running `av stack adopt` specifying the parent branch (in this case `master`) adds metadata for the current branch `mytopic`. Now, if you run `av stack tree`, you can see that `mytopic` is correctly recognized as a child of `master`.

```
$ av stack adopt
Choose which branches to adopt (Use space to select / deselect).
  * mytopic (HEAD, chosen for adoption)
  │   New commit
  │
  * master
```
