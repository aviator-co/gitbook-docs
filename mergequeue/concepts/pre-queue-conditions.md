# Pre-Queue Conditions

You can set up the conditions that a PR must meet before entering a queue. You can configure following pre-queue conditions:

* Number of approvals
* Required GitHub checks
* Pass the GitHub's mergeability
* Require all conversations to be resolved
* Custom regexp checks on the PR title and body

Without meeting these conditions, a PR cannot go into a queue.
