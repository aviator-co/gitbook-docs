# Batching

Batching works alongside Parallel mode to increase the throughput of PRs merged, by merging more PRs per CI run.

## How it works

### Config Settings

There are two settings to set in your configuration file.

`batch_size` = This is the number of queued PRs batched together for a draft PR CI run. Defaults to 1.

`batch_max_wait_minutes`= The time to wait before creating the next batch of PRs, e.g. if `batch_size` = 3 but there are only currently 2 queued PRs, then a batch of those 2 PRs will be created after `batch_max_wait_minutes`. Defaults to 0.

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
merge_rules:  
    labels:    
        trigger: "label_name"
    merge_mode:
        type: "parallel"
        parallel_mode:
            batch_size: 3
            batch_max_wait_minutes: 0
```

### Current workflow

Here is the current workflow of parallel mode. It defaults to `batch_size`=1 since each additional CI pipeline will combine the changes from 1 PR and all the previous PRs in the queue.

### Workflow with batching

By adjusting `batch_size`, your repo can merge PRs faster with reduced CI runs. Let’s look at an example where `batch_size=3` and we have 6 total tagged PRs.

Pipeline #1 will batch together the changes from PR#1, PR#2, and PR#3. Once the CI passes, PRs 1-3 will be merged.

Pipeline #2 will batch together the changes from Pipeline #1 and PR#4, PR#5, and PR#6. Once the CI passes, PRs 4-6 will be merged.

By increasing the `batch_size` from 1 to 3, we can merge 6 PRs vs 2 PRs in the same time it takes to run 2 CI pipelines.

Here’s a quick comparison of how many additional CI pipelines\* are run with different batch sizes for a **queue with 10 PRs**.

\*Additional CI pipelines are the CI runs in addition to the CI that runs on the original PR.

### Handling Failures

#### Bisection

It's inevitable that we will run into build failures - we handle this by requeuing PRs into bisected batches.

For example, let's say our `batch_size`=5 and we have PRs #1-5 in a single batch, with the corresponding draft PR #6.

If the draft PR fails, then we will close draft PR #6, and requeue all of PRs #1-5. These PRs will be put into two bisected batches - the first batch contains PRs #1-3, the second batch contains PRs #4-5.

If a PR in the batch fails, we similarly requeue with bisection. In the above example, if PR #1 fails, then we block PR #1 and requeue PRs #2-5. Those PRs will be requeued into two batches - PRs #2-3 in one batch, PRs #4-5 in the other.

#### Other FAQs

<details>

<summary>How do you handle PRs with a skip_label?</summary>

All PRs with skip labels will be prioritized. They will be bumped to the top of the queue and will always be in its own batch. PRs with a skip\_label will never be batched with other PRs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if I dequeue a PR?</summary>

The corresponding draft PRs as well as any subsequent draft PRs will be closed. PRs in the current batch will be requeued.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if I add a new commit?</summary>

If you add a new commit to a PR, the associated draft PR will be closed and all subsequent draft PRs will be reset. The PRs in the batch will be automatically requeued.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if my PR fails to merge but other PRs in the batch succeed?</summary>

If your PR fails to merge, we will automatically retry merging again. If it still fails, the PR will be blocked and may require manual changes.

<details>

<summary>What happens if I close the draft PR associated with multiple PRs?</summary>

If you manually close a draft PR, this will trigger a full reset of the queue. All draft PRs will be closed, and all PRs will be requeued.

<details>

<summary>What happens if I close my PR?</summary>

If you manually close a PR that has been queued and has an associated draft PR, this will trigger a full reset of the queue. All draft PRs will be closed and all PRs are requeued.
