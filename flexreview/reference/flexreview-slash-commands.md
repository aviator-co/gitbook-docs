# Slash commands

### Suggest

The suggest command gets a reviewer suggestion as a Pull Request comment. It has additional debugging information in suggestion, such as how many candidates there were, the expert scores of the candidates, etc..

```jsx
/aviator flexreview suggest
```

### Assign

The assign command is similar to the suggest command, but it also assigns the suggested reviewer.

```
/aviator flexreview assign
```
