# Mandate an expert approval \[Deprecated]



{% hint style="info" %}
The approval requirement section is now deprecated, so the mandatary approvals now follow the same rules as specificied in GitHub Codeowners file.
{% endhint %}

In order to mandate expert approvals on PRs, you can use FlexReview’s Approval Check along with required status checks.

In the FlexReview configuration, set up the file paths under `Approval Check`. You can use the same file paths as the reviewer suggestion file paths, or specify something else. This will add an `aviator/flexreview` GitHub status check.

#### Set up MergeQueue required status checks

If your repo is set up to use Aviator’s MergeQueue, navigate to the MergeQueue config. Make sure to set `aviator/flexreview` as a required check. This requires the PR to have an expert approval before Aviator will merge the PR.

#### Set up GitHub required status checks

If your repo is not set up to use MergeQueue, you can simply add `aviator/flexreview` as a required check on GitHub.
