# Get a reviewer suggestion

### Manual Slash command

With the Aviator app installed on your GitHub repository, it is possible to request suggested reviewers from FlexReview. This is done using a GitHub comment slash command:

```
/aviator flexreview suggest
```

FlexReview will post a comment showing the recommended reviewers, the PR author's expertise score, and alternate reviewers.

### View suggested reviewers without adding comments to a PR

The Aviator webapp provides a way to see FlexReview suggestions without posting a comment to your pull requests. Visit [<mark style="color:blue;">Aviator FlexReview Suggest</mark>](https://app.aviator.co/flexreview/suggest).
