# Get a reviewer suggestion



### Manual Slash command

With the aviator app installed on your GitHub repository, it is possible to request suggested reviewers from FlexReview. This is done using a github comment slashcommand:

```
/aviator flexreview suggest
```

Afterwards, we can see a comment posted by FlexReview showing the recommended reviewers, their calculated score for this PR and their review load. 


### View suggested reviewers without adding comments to a PR
