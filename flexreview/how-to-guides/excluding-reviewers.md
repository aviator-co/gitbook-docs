# Excluding reviewers

In a large organization, it may be desired to exclude certain reviewers from being suggested. These could be SREs, managers, product managers, designers or other inactive collaborators who may have access to the code base, and have contributed in the past but are passive collaborators now.&#x20;

The excluded reviewers are still accepted for approval check validation, but are never suggested by FlexReview.

To exclude the reviewers, go to [Repositories list view](https://app.aviator.co/repos), search for the repository that you want to change, and select FlexReview Status > Configure.
