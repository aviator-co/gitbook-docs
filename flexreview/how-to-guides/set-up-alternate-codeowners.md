# Set up alternate CODEOWNERS \[Deprecated]

{% hint style="info" %}
We now recommend having a more relaxed / lightweight Codeowners file instead of setting up an alternate Codeowners path.
{% endhint %}

If you have a `CODEOWNERS` file defined in `./github`, GitHub will attempt to auto-assign reviewers from `CODEOWNERS`.

In order to take the full advantage of FlexReview, we recommend renaming or moving the `CODEOWNERS` file.

You can set the absolute path to the CODEOWNERS file on the FlexReview config page.
