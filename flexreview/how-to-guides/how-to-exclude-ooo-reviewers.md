# How to Exclude OOO Reviewers

FlexReview allows users to mark their out of office dates in Aviator to prevent them getting auto assigned when they're away. This helps reduce the load on their teammates who no longer have to keep an eye out of stray reviews and also helps the PR creators not have to chase down an unavailable user.

## Setting you or a teammate's out of office dates

Navigate to the Settings -> Out of Office page in your Personal settings. If you've noticed a teammate forgot to set their own OOO, you can navigate to their Github user in the top right corner. Then fill in the form with the start and end dates for the out of office event, and optionally leave the reason so your teammates know where you are.
