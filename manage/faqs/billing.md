# Billing FAQs

<details>

<summary>Do I need a credit card to sign up?</summary>

No, the trial period does not require any payment methods. You can use the product risk free for the first 14 days. We will only start charging you after 14 days, so whenever you are satisfied with Aviator, you can add your credit card in the billing section.

<summary>How do I know how much I will be charged?</summary>

For each service, we charge based on the number of active GitHub collaborators in your repository. You can review the count of Billed users in the Billing section of Aviator.

For MergeQueue, active collaborators are defined as the collaborators who have created a Pull Request and have used Aviator on their PRs.

For FlexReview, active collaborators are defined as the collaborators who have created a Pull Request in a repository where FlexReview is enabled.

For Releases, active collaborators are defined as the collaborators who have merged a Pull Request that was deployed using Aviator Releases.

<summary>What is the difference between a collaborator and a user?</summary>

A collaborator is a GitHub user associated with the organization or repository.

An Aviator user, on the other hand, is someone who has access to the Aviator dashboard. There is no cost associated with the number of users you have in your Aviator account for any plan, you only pay based on the number of active collaborators.

<summary>How is pricing calculated for multiple products?</summary>

The usage and pricing is calculated for each product separately. For instance, it's possible that you are using only 20 collaborators for FlexReview and 50 collaborators MergeQueue.

Each of our products have a free tier, when you exceed the usage for a specific tier, you enter the Pro tier for that product. The billing for each product is totaled every month and depending on the qualified active collaborators, the final price is calculated.

For instance, if you have the following usage:

* 20 collaborators for FlexReview
* 50 collaborators for MergeQueue
* 10 collaborators for Releases

Then your total monthly bill would be:

```
20*12 + 50*12 + 10*8 = $920
```
