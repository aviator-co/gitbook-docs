# AttentionSet Chrome extension

Aviator’s [<mark style="color:blue;">Chrome extension</mark>](../mergequeue/aviator-chrome-extension.md) also lets you view AttentionSet directly from the GitHub UI. Similar to the Aviator dashboard workflow, you can see all the PRs that are waiting for your attention, indicated by the orange flag on the GitHub’s PR list view:

And toggle the attention on and off for the authors and reviewers from the PR details view page, right under the Reviewers section.
