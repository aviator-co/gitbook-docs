# Attention reasons

AttentionSet follows very similar rules as explained by Gerrit, and it then states the reason for attention assignment. Following reasons may be assigned for a getting attention:

* A code review has been assigned to you
* A reviewer commented on the PR authored by you
* A reviewer approved a PR authored by you
* Someone manually assigned the attention to you
* A required status check is failing on the PR authored by you

And likewise there may be PRs associated with you but are waiting on actions from others:

* A PR is waiting for the reviewerâ€™s comments
* A PR you reviewed is waiting on the author to take an action
* You manually removed attention from this PR
* The PR is in queue waiting to be merged
